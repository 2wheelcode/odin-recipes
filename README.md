# odin-recipes
Have completed a few HTML basic courses, and found TOP
Brand New to Terminal and Command Line, I am so unsure of what I am doing, it's not even funny! If someone finds this, please drop me a message and let me know that it's actually working!
This is the first Odin project, and I'm going to have  a little fun with it, hope you enjoy...yes, I know I have a weird sense of humor ;)
Did a few commits
Fixed issues
May add the extra pics later
Do not know what .DS_Store is or where it came from?
Basic layout complete
Want to add the "Roadwarrior Recipe" Title over the header image later...

*THIS IS COMPLETE SATIRE!

I don't understand, when I run this "live" in Chrome on my computer, the main image header shows...Why doesn't it here?
